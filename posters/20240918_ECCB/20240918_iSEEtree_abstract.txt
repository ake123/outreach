iSEEtree: an R package for the interactive visualisation of microbiome data

Giulio Benedetti, Ely Seraidarian, Leo Lahti

Microbiome data convey information about the community of microorganisms that inhabit the ecosystem under investigation. Due to its considerable impact on human health and the environment, microbiome profiling has been widely adopted as a routine analysis in biomedical as well as ecological research. In response to this tendency, the R/Bioconductor community has developed a reproducible data science framework that is comprehensively described in the book Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis. Such framework is based upon highly generic and optimised data containers known as TreeSummarizedExperiment and the mia family of packages, which provide statistical and analytical methods for microbiome data stored in such containers. While this framework may appear familiar to practitioners who are competent in the R programming language, experiment-driven researchers may prefer a user-friendly alternative to analyse and visualise microbiome data. Thus, we conceived iSEEtree, an R package that extends the interactive graphics functionality of the readily existing iSEE package to TreeSummarizedExperiment objects. With iSEEtree, the user can create and interact with phylogenetic trees, composition plots, diversity indices of a microbial community and more, without an in-depth knowledge of the underlying mia functionality. We hope that iSEEtree, which is currently under development, will assist new and experienced users alike in discovering and contributing to microbiome research.
