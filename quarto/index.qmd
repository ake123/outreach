## Contributions

You are welcome to add new presentations or improve the current ones. The workflow for contributors is explained [here](https://github.com/microbiome/OMA#development-and-contributions). The presentations are deployed from [this directory](https://github.com/microbiome/outreach/blob/main/quarto/), so you need to make the respective changes there and run `cd quarto/; quarto render`. [This documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command) provides more details about publishing quarto presentations with GitHub Pages.
