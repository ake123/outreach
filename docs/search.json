The presentations are deployed from the quarto sub-directory, so you need to make the respective changes there and run cd quarto/; quarto render.\nThe following is a quick workflow for contributions:\n\nfork the repository\nadd your qmd file(s) to the quarto sub-directory\nupdate the _quarto.yml file and the list of presentations in the website with the name of the qmd file(s) with your presentation(s)\nrun quarto render from your terminal from within the quarto sub-directory\nand make a pull request to the master branch\n\nThis documentation provides more details about publishing quarto presentations with GitHub Pages."
